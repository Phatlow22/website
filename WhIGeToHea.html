    <h1>RUNNING CADENCES</h1>
    <h2>Name: When I get to heaven</h2>
    <p>
        When I get to heaven<br>
St. Peter's gonna say,<br>
"How'd you earn your livin' boy,<br>
How'd you earn your pay?"<br>
I'll reply with a whole lot of anger,<br>
"Made my living as an Airborne Ranger!<br>
Blood, guts, sex, and danger<br>
That's the life of an Airborne Ranger!"<br>
When I get to Hell<br>
Satan's gonna say,<br>
"How'd you earn your livin' boy,<br>
How'd you earn your pay?"<br>
I'll reply with a fist to his face,<br>
"Made my living laying SOULS to waste!" <br>
